## Latest News 9:00 pm PST 12/11/2025
- The Programming placement test is underway at hackerrank url [EMS ACSL Placement test 2025](https://www.hackerrank.com/ems-acsl-placement-test-2025)
  - The [Hacker Rank Signup Steps](#hacker-rank-signup) steps are below.
- For students facing issues like compilation error please see the [Hacker Rank Gotchas](#hacker-rank-Gotchas)

## Hacker Rank Signup
- You need to create a account at [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
  - This is fast and free.
  - Same account would be used for both **for the placement test as well as ACSL**
- Once logged in you can visit [EMS ACSL Placement test 2025](https://www.hackerrank.com/ems-acsl-placement-test-2025) and click on sign up.

- Once you sign up you would see 3 problems to solve which are due by 12/13 11:00 pm
- Check the [Hacker Rank Gotchas](#hacker-rank-Gotchas) for any issues 

## Hacker Rank Gotchas
- **Make sure to select right programming language**
  - If you are programming in C++(e.g. using cin/cout), make sure to select either C++ as it is different from C language and cin/cout won't work in C.
     - There are also C++14,C++20 which would work too but are slightly different.
  - If you are programming in Python, the 2 options are Python2 or Python3. Chose one that you are familiar with, latest is Python3
  - Similary for Java there are multiple versions of Java language you should try choosing Java, or if that does not work try using one of the other Java versions (like Java8, Java 15)
- **Make sure to limit your input/output to what is strictly necessary**
  - **Do** : Directly use input(e.g. ```cin>>var1;``` in C++ ) and output and dont use any additional helper or informative messages. 
  - **Don't**
    - I see that some students are outputting a hello message e.g. ```cout<<"insert two numbers";``` This is not required and would actually cause your program to fail due to output mismatch.
    - Similarly when outputting the result just output the result and nothing else; The messages are going to hurt your score and make the output evaluate incorrectly
- If you are in doubt about the code , run it in your IDE first and then paste in hackerank, that way you can debug better locally.

## Test Rules
- This test must be completed individually, all the work should be student’s own. 
- Using AI tools, looking up solutions or collaboration is prohibited
- **However students may use textbook/programming manual to look up programming syntax only or apis.**
